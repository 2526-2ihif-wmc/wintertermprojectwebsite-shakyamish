            <h3>Abyssinian</h3>
        <p>
            The Abyssinian has a friendly and outgoing personality, so they love to play and hate being alone. 
            While this medium-sized cat is very social, their adaptable temperament and playful nature allow them 
            to find fun in tackling toys or racing up and down stairs (or scratching posts) all by themselves. 
            Soon enough, though, an Aby will seek attention from their housemates, no matter the species.

            Full-grown around a year of age, the Abyssinian will maintain a kitten-like quality well into 
            adulthood despite their elegant, refined appearance. 
            Abyssinians are known as “Aby-grabbys” because they like to grab things and knock them off counters. 
            Also, these cats are known as the “clowns of the cat kingdom,” and are even referred to as 
            “Aby-silly-an.” Their silly, playful nature helps them get along great with dogs.

        <p>
            The Aegean cat has a friendly, confident personality and thrives on companionship, 
            making them happiest when they're part of everyday household life. 
            Social and intelligent, they enjoy interactive play and will gladly follow their people from room to room, 
            curious about everything that's going on. While they can entertain themselves for a while, 
            Aegeans prefer having company and aren't fans of being ignored for too long.

            Reaching full maturity around one year of age, the Aegean cat retains a playful, 
            youthful spirit well into adulthood. Agile and athletic, they love climbing, chasing, and exploring, 
            often with a surprisingly strong fascination for water. Known for their talkative nature and expressive behaviors, 
            these cats aren't shy about asking for attention. Their easygoing, 
            affectionate temperament helps them get along well with children, other cats, and even dogs, 
            making them a natural fit for lively, social homes.

                Slow to fully mature, the American Curl keeps a kitten-like enthusiasm well into adulthood. 
                Their signature backward-curled ears give them a perpetually surprised expression that perfectly matches their lively, 
                inquisitive spirit. Often described as friendly and polite, these cats tend to greet guests warmly and get along well with children,
